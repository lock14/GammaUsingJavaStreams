# Gamma Join: Using Java Streams

This was inspired by a project I did for the class Automated Software Design at the University of Texas at Austing [[link]](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dsb/cs392f/)

(link to assignment page if your interested: [writeup](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dsb/cs392f/Assignments/GammaProject/index.html))

The goal was to implement the Gamma Join Architecture using the Java Streams paradigm. I was unable to come up with an exact one-to-one
mapping of the Gamma Join Architecture, but I did manage to come extremely close while strictly adhering to the Java Streams APIs
and paradigms.

This Project requires MDELite as dependency. [link](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/schwartz/MDELite/index.html)
