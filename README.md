# GammaUsingJavaStreams

This was inspired by a project I did for the class Automated Software Design at the University of Texas at Austing (link to assignment page if your interested: [writeup](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dsb/cs392f/Assignments/GammaProject/index.html))

The goal was to implement the Gamma Join Architecture using the Java Streams pardigm. While this project does not achieve a 100% mapping it does come as close as possible while still using the Java Streams APIs only.

This Project requires MDELite as dependency. [link:](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/schwartz/MDELite/index.html)
